################## AIRLINES README ##################
Contained below is information regarding a commonly used airlines data set and additional resource files that could be used with the airlines data for analysis. 

Source information as well as names of processed data files (where relevant) are provided under DATA SETS. Variable descriptions for the data sets are provide by data set in section following the AIRLINES DATA DOWNLOAD section

Scripts described below were created by James Balamuta,  March 2015.

################## DATA SETS ##################
1. airlines 
The Airlines Dataset comes from the US Department of Transportations Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

To download the inital raw data, see the BTS Data Selector:
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/NewAirportList.asp?xpage=OT_DelayCause1.asp&flag=undefined

A script for downloading data from year ranges is provided in the AIRLINES DATA DOWNLOAD section below.

2. airports (airports.csv)
The Airport data set comes from the Open Flights initiative found here:
http://openflights.org/data.html

3. carriers (carriers.csv)
The Carriers Dataset comes from the US Department of Transportations Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download_Lookup.asp?Lookup=L_UNIQUE_CARRIERS

4. plane-data (plane-data.csv)
The Plane Data Dataset comes from the FAA registration database found here:
http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/


################## AIRLINES DATA DOWNLOAD ##################

The airlines data has already been downloaded from that source and is available here:
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

James Balamuta has written a download script that will download and format the data. The script is located here:
https://github.com/coatless/stat490uiuc/blob/master/airlines/airlines_data.sh

Specifically, the script will:
1. Download the data from a provided year range.
2. Unzip the data.
3. Combine the data into one file: airlines.csv
4. Clean up after itself (e.g. delete directory and itself)

To use the script:

# Download script
wget 

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coatless/stat490uiuc/master/airlines/airlines_data.sh
chmod u+x airlines_data.sh

# Run the script
./airlines_data.sh <start year> <end year>
